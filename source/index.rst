Documentation for Robot Air Hockey Challenge
===================================

`Robot Air Hockey Challenge <https://https://sites.google.com/view/rahc-2023>`_ provides a platform for researchers in the field of robot learning to interact with each other on a realistic robotic task. In this competition, teams will design and build their own robot air hockey agents, competing against each other in different levels of tasks and finally in a entire game. 

The challenges is consist of 3 stages. 

The goal of this document is to provide a basic introduction to the challenge's library, including :ref:`installation`, :ref:`environments`, :ref:`agent`, :ref:`constraints`, :ref:`submission`, and :ref:`replay`.

We encourage teams to think outside the box and come up with unique strategies for their agents. We wish all teams the best of luck in the competition, and can't wait to see the innovative solutions that will be competing!

For information on general rules, important dates, etc., please see the challenge website https://https://sites.google.com/view/rahc-2023.
